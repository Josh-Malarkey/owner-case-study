# Owner Case Study

## GTM Analytics: Key Findings & Recommendations

Analysis of Owner.com's go-to-market data across funnel conversion, account LTV, channel, and unit economics to identify the highest-leverage opportunities for scaling 2-3x while improving CAC:LTV ratio.

### Executive Summary

These two opportunities compound each other. Fixing outbound's contact-to-meeting rate from 4% → 8% would roughly double outbound wins (from ~17/mo to ~34/mo) while halving outbound CAC and unlocking higher-LTV accounts that outbound is uniquely positioned to target. 

Simultaneously, reallocating ~$15K/mo of outbound headcount spend into inbound ad budget could yield ~15-20 additional inbound wins/month at current efficiency (~$730-$1,130 ad spend per won deal). These combined initiatives add ~30 incremental wins/month on a current base of ~80-120 (total accounts won across both channels), representing a ~30% lift within a year while improving blended CAC:LTV from ~9x toward 11-13x as the mix shifts toward the more efficient inbound channel.

### Opportunity 1: Fix the Outbound Funnel Bottleneck (Contact → Meeting Conversion)

This is the single highest-leverage fix. Outbound generates ~2x the lead volume of inbound but converts at 1/10th the rate to close. The data shows exactly where value is destroyed:

| Metric | Inbound | Outbound |
|---|---|---|
| Contact → Meeting rate | 45-52% | 1.8-5.4% |
| Demo → Close rate | 33-46% | 21-36% |
| CAC | $1,249-$2,086 | $1,587-$6,250 |
| Avg 24mo LTV | ~$16K | ~$18K |

The outbound funnel is healthy at both ends with a contact-to-DM (decision maker) rate between 20%-53%, anda  demo-to-close rate between 21%-36%. However, 95%+ of leads are being lost because of the extremely low contact-to-meeting rate of 4%. Meanwhile, outbound wins tend to be higher-LTV accounts (~$18K vs ~$16K inbound) because BDRs can target upmarket.

**Actionable next steps:**
- Audit outbound sequences: the meeting-book rate suggests reps are reaching DMs but failing to convert interest into scheduled meetings
- Segment outbound by predicted monthly sales (the LTV data shows accounts with >$5K predicted monthly sales yield 24mo LTV of $18K-$27K) and focus outbound effort there
- Even moving contact-to-meeting from 4% → 8% would roughly halve outbound CAC while targeting higher-value accounts

### Opportunity 2: Shift Investment Mix Toward Inbound to Fund Scalable Growth

The data shows a stark efficiency gap between channels. Inbound is ~2x more capital-efficient across every metric, yet remains volume-constrained by ad spend:

| Metric | Inbound | Outbound |
|---|---|---|
| Avg CAC | ~$1,500 | ~$2,800 |
| Avg LTV:CAC | **11x** | **7.7x** |
| Lead-to-close rate | **5.3%** | **0.9%** |
| Payback period | ~2.2 mo | ~3.7 mo |

Outbound is consuming $38K-$50K/month in people cost while producing only 8-25 accounts won/month (vs inbound's 61-94). The June outbound cohort hit a $6,250 CAC with just 8 wins and a 3.1x LTV:CAC — dangerously close to unprofitable. Meanwhile, inbound ad spend ($54K-$68K/mo) is the primary volume constraint — the funnel conversion rates are healthy and stable.

**Actionable next steps:**
- Reallocate 30-40% of outbound headcount spend into inbound ad budget. The outbound people cost is $38K-$50K/mo (`PEOPLE_COST` in channel economics, with $0 ad spend), so 30-40% equates to ~$11K-$20K/mo additional investment in inbound
- The current inbound efficiency is ~$730-$1,130 in ad spend per won deal (derived from $55-68K monthly ad spend and 50-79 accounts closed-won), and an incremental $15K/month in ad spend could yield ~15-20 additional accounts wons/month, a ~25-30% lift on current inbound volume
- Monitor inbound CAC closely for diminishing returns as spend scales — the Jan-May data shows CAC remained stable ($1,249-$1,389) across varying spend levels, suggesting room to grow before saturation
- Use the payback period advantage (~2 months inbound vs ~4 months outbound) to reinvest recovered cash into further growth quarters ahead
